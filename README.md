# Coding Assignment 14 - UC Portfolio Website

This project is a **React portfolio website** designed to showcase various projects and coursework completed in the program. Built with reusable components, the portfolio is optimized for deployment and can be easily run in a Docker container. The site allows viewers to explore the creatorâ€™s skills, projects, and other details relevant to software development.

In addition to the portfolio, the project setup includes **Husky** for pre-commit checks to maintain code quality. **GitHub Actions** also enforce automated checks on each push and pull request to keep the repository clean and error-free.
